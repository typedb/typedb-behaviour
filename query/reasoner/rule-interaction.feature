  Scenario: when two distinct rules have alpha-equivalent bodies and heads, the reasoner still sees them as distinct.
  More explicitly, suppose we have rule A and rule B. Suppose up to alpha equivalence A.when == B.when and
  A.then == B.then. But the {rule A} != {rule B} because the bindings of the variables makes the meaning of A.then
  distinct from B.then. In such a situation, the reasoner does not mistake the rules as equivalent.
